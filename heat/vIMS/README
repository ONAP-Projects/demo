This heat template allows the deployement of the clearwater vIMS [1],
a fully functional open source vIMS solution.

The current heat template is derivated from the heat templates published
by Metaswitch [2].
Initial templates have been adapted to be VVP compliant (they are tested
through VVP linting in onap-tests repository [3])

These templates still require Ubuntu 14.04 as base image and would need some 
adaptations to be upgraded with more recent ubuntu base images to perform
the userdata part at boot.

They are integrated in Orange Openlab onap-tests CI chains and part of
the non regression end to end tests used at ONAP gating for OOM [4] [5].

It has been succesfully tested on ONAP Beijing, Casablanca and Master.
